# 225-Team-Bien-MAC-cam

## FOR FUTURE DEVELOPERS
* Platform: Processing v3.5.4 
* Libraries : OpenCV, ControlP5, Video, Minim, G4P 
* System: Windows/ (Poentially older MacOs but was never tested)
* To connect to zoom: Use OBS (see more at:https://obsproject.com)
* Download the zip file, extract it and click on exe to test

## Ultimate goals:  
A live cam software  for Macalester that runs on computers, which integrates all kinds of filters, especially macalester-themed filters, and you can take pictures/record videos.

## Audience for launch: 
Macalester Community. We will design some macalester-related filters which suit our community. 

## Risks: 
* For more complex filters, we may struggle with processing the video fast enough to have a smooth user experience

* Some of the more complex filters might require better GPU to run smoothly

* The development of the painting function might be really time consuming. 

* None of us are on campus so we might need extra help to get the background pictures for Macalester.

* We are all new to Processing so we might encounter a lot of unexpected technical difficulties.

## Phases & timeline: 
* Phase 1: A live cam software where you can adjust saturation, hue, colors of the live video and you can take pictures/record videos.(MVP)

* Phase 2: We start adding basic filters

* (Midterm)Phase 3: We make more complex filters : 
Make the filter customizable(Stickers),
Animated stickers/theme(GIF)

* Phase 4: Complex filters: 
 Have pipe music playing in the background for Macalester-specific filters 
 Have a painting filter(optional)
 
* Phase 5:  Complex filters:
Face recognition filters (OpenCV library?)
Customized filters & Changing background

* Phase 6: Sharing on social media, have a “MAC filter” community account
