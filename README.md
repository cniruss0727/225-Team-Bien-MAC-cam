# 225-Team-Bien-MAC-cam


## Ultimate goals:  
A live cam software  for Macalester that runs on computers, which integrates all kinds of filters, especially macalester-themed filters, and you can take pictures/record videos.

-## Audience for launch: Macalester Community. We will design some macalester-related filters which suit our community. 

## Risks: 
##a.For more complex filters, we may struggle with processing the video fast enough to have a smooth user experience
##b.Some of the more complex filters might require better GPU to run smoothly
##c.The development of the painting function might be really time consuming. 
d.None of us are on campus so we might need extra help to get the background pictures for Macalester.
e.We are all new to Processing so we might encounter a lot of unexpected technical difficulties.

-**Phases & timeline**: 
Phase 1: A live cam software where you can adjust saturation, hue, colors of the live video and you can take pictures/record videos.(MVP)
Phase 2: We start adding basic filters
(Midterm)Phase 3: We make more complex filters : 
Make the filter customizable(Stickers),
Animated stickers/theme(GIF)
Phase 4: Complex filters: 
 Have pipe music playing in the background for Macalester-specific filters 
 Have a painting filter(optional)
Phase 5:  Complex filters:
Face recognition filters (OpenCV library?)
Customized filters & Changing background
Phase 6: Sharing on social media, have a “MAC filter” community account
